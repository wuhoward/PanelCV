* For a generative-discriminative pair (NB and LR)
  * The discriminative model has a lower asymptote error
  * The generative model need less training data, more robust to the noise
* Discriminative
  * Model $ P(y \vert x) $
  * Logistic Regression: $ P(y=1 \vert x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} $
  * Directly learn the (hard or soft) boundary 
  * E.g. Conditional Random Fields (CRF)
* Generative
  * Model $ P(x, y) = P(x \vert y)P(y) $
  * Usually harder to model $ P(x \vert y) \Rightarrow $ Naive Bayes assumes conditional independence of $ x_i $
  * Learn the distribution of the data, or how the data is generated from each class, then determine the most likely class
  * E.g. Naive Bayes, Bayesian Network, Markov Random Field, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Gaussian Mixture Model
