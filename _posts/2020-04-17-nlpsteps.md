[HRank: Filter Pruning using High-Rank Feature Map](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.10179.pdf)
* The average rank of multiple feature maps generated by a single filter is always the same
* Estimate ranks by 500 input images
* Prune by filter importance (rank)


[Big Transfer (BiT): General Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11370)
* A pretrained model good for downstream tasks
* Group Normalization (GN): across a few channels of a feature map
* GN + weight standardization > BN when:
  * Training large models with small per-device batches
  * BN not good for transfer (need running mean/var)
